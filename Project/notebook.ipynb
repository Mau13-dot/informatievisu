    "Climate change is one of the most pressing debates of todays society, (most) scientists have come to the conclusion that if we don't do something quickly, humanity is in serious danger from the consequences. We decided to look at what the root of this problem is, more specificly, which industrial sector is currently the biggest threat to our society. There are a few obvious contenders, many may think the biggest emission source are fossil fuels, or more general the fuel industry. We will try to see wether this is accurate or not by comparing the emissions of different\n",
    "industries throughout the years. We have found two different perspectives: \n",
    "\n",
    "Our first perspective on the topic is that it is necessary to switch from fossil fuels to\n",
    "renewable energy sources. Fossil fuels have a massive impact on climate change due to their large\n",
    "amount of greenhouse gas emission. Immediate action is required to look for greener fuels and energy\n",
    "with lower amounts of greenhouse gas emission. This would help slow down the climate change drastically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our second perspective is that the biggest problem isn’t the energie sector, but something\n",
    "entirely different. For instance a while ago it came to light how big of an impact the meat\n",
    "industry has on CO2 emissions across the world, because of how many acres of land\n",
    "espescially cows need to be fed and kept. Examples like this lead us to believe that the\n",
    "fossil fuel industrie probably isn’t the biggest threat to the rappid climate change\n",
    "happening right now."
